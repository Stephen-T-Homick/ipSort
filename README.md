# IP Address Concatenator

This Python script takes a file containing IP addresses as input and concatenates them into a sorted list. The script then formats the IP addresses by separating them with commas and enclosing each address in quotes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Create a file named `ip_addresses.txt` in the same directory as the script.

3. Populate the `ip_addresses.txt` file with the IP addresses you want to process. Each IP address should be on a separate line.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt.

5. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python script.py ip_addresses.txt
